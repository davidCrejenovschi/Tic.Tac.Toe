ou can now play Tic Tac Toe on a screen! The backend is written in C++, and the user interface is a hybrid built using SDL2 and ImGui.

It features local network (LAN) multiplayer, meaning you and your friends will actually have to meet up in person to play. Sure, it was way easier for me to code it this way, but let's call it a feature: nowadays, the real "pandemic" is everyone just playing online from their own isolated rooms. At least this game forces you to actually hang out in the same place! PC and mobile devices seamlessly can play together.
